To install the game (in fact the software needed to run the game) follow the following steps:

MAC

1) Open a terminal
2) Go to the directory where the game's files are located ( typing 'cd Downloads/GameClient-master/GameClient-master' should work)
3) Type 'sudo chmod 755 install_mac.sh' and press enter (You will probably need to type your password)
4) Type './install_mac.sh', it will install all the necessary things 
5) Type 'sudo chmod 755 launch_mac.py' and press enter
6) That's it!
To launch the game, double-click on 'launch_mac.command' (it's in the GameClient folder)

WINDOWS

1) Open a command prompt (cmd) (invite de commande en fran√ßais)
2) Go to the directory where the game's files are located ( typing 'cd Downloads\GameClient-master\GameClient-master' should work)
3) Type 'install_windows.bat' and follow the instructions (you need to add python to PATH!)
4) That's it!
To launch the game, double-click on 'launch_mac.bat' (it's in the GameClient folder)
NOTE: you can create a shortcut on the desktop

Once the installation is completed, you can move the GameClient folder wherever you want and delete the other files
